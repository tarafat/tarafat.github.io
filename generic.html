								<h3>Who I Am</h3>
								<p>This is Arafat, born and brought up in Khulna. Schooling and most of my educational institutions are from Khulna. 
									Studied in Khulna Zilla School. One of the oldest and historical School in Bangladesh established in year 
									1885 from there I passed S.S.S. examination in the year 2007 in business studies.
									After that I went to M.M. City College,Khulna  and passed  H.S.S. examination in the year 2009 also from business studies.
									Then I got admitted in Azom Khan Govt. commerce college and completed my graduation in Finance and Banking.
									As I was searching for an opportunity to start my job career I went for H.R. and got admitted to 
									Bangladesh Institute of Management.
									From there I came to understand the reason of unemployment, is graduations without proper skills.								</p>
								<p>
									Though I was doing good in BIM but as I knew the truth this time I wanted to get some solid 
									set of skills to be able to contribute to the organization. 
									Eventually I came to know about IDB-BISEW IT Scholarship project and went for it got 
									selected and offered one of their best course which is ESAD-J2EE. 
									I decided to continue with both of them and ended up with diploma in HRM from BIM and OCJP certifications from Orcale.

								</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>What I Do</h4>
								<p>Just after the end of the diploma I got an offer to work as Software developer from ZABERP Ltd. 
									Since January 2018 I am working with one of the successful ERP provider in Bangladesh.
									34 ERP of United Group runs on ZABERP.
									Currently, I am working with 4 of them commonly known as Unimart Holdings.
									In the very beginning of my job career 
									I worked as assistance for Unimart's ERP deployment phase-1. From where I gather solid 
									knowledge about sales module and retail ERP as well.
									At 7 month of the job a new requirement came from United to make a POS for one of their concern 
									named as "Chef's Table".
									I was assigned by my organization along with a newly recruited JAVA developer.It was a two mans team.

								</p>
								 <p>With my 7 months of ERP experience we started building POS.
									Where my role was to develop the back end (up to controller) maintaining the ERP logic
									so that it can be merged with ZABERP satisfying FnB business requirements 
									and it also has to be able to be deployed as 
									standalone POS for other shops under the food court hood.
									We ended up this project after four months and went for the test deployment.								</p>
								<p>
									Currently, we have 100+ deployment of this POS. Where the sole responsibility of this project is mine
									maintaining 14 VPS servers to satisfy the business requirements where real time data synchronization 
									is prerequisite for the operation which is also built by me using sql server replication. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Being a java developer I always had an attraction over android and wanted to work with it.
									So on my own interest I started to learn flutter.
									For last one year I had my head into it. And have built few apps.Learning FCM, Firebase Auth, Firestore, Provider,
									SQLite.Now I am working with a distribution system app which is assigned by my organization for two of
									the largest company of Bangladesh where I am applying all of my knowledge over Flutter  as it's a solo project.
									Currently, I am looking for 
									a better working opportunity where I can learn, work and bring out more of me.								</p>
